 * Class CascadingStats is the base class for all Cascading statistics gathering. It also reports the status of

 * There are five states the stats object reports; pending, running, completed, failed, stopped, and finished.
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>pending</code> - when the Flow or Cascade has yet to start.</li>
 * <li><code>running</code> - when the Flow or Cascade is executing a workload.</li>
 * <li><code>successful</code> - when the Flow or Cascade naturally completed its workload without failure.</li>
 * <li><code>failed</code> - when the Flow or Cascade threw an error and failed to finish the workload.</li>
 * <li><code>stopped</code> - when the user calls stop() on the Flow or Cascade.</li>
 * <li><code>finished</code> - when the Flow or Cascade is no longer processing a workload and <code>completed</code>,
 * <code>failed</code>, or <code>stopped</code> is true.</li>
